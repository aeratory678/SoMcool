# SoMcool

A vibrant, interactive web page celebrating the "Summer of Making" — but with a playful twist on AI slop. This project is a visual playground built with HTML5 Canvas, dynamic JavaScript animations, and a wild, animated CSS background.

## ✨ Features

- **Animated Canvas Text:** Multicolor, glitchy text in various fonts, undulating and changing every half-second.
- **Particle Effects:** Colorful, glowing particles orbit the center for a lively atmosphere.
- **Floating Shapes:** Soft, pastel circles drift across the screen with unique blend modes.
- **Glass Overlay:** Adds a frosted glass effect for depth and style.
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically adapts to any screen size.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build steps or dependencies required!

### Files

- **index.html** — Main HTML file; links everything together.
- **script.js** — Handles all canvas animation, particles, shapes, and text effects.
- **style.css** — Controls the background animation, glass effect, and floating shapes styles.

## 🖌️ Customization

- Change or add fonts in `index.html` and the `fonts` array in `script.js`.
- Edit the main text in `script.js` by modifying the `text` variable.
- Adjust colors, number of particles/shapes, or animation speed in `script.js` and `style.css`.
